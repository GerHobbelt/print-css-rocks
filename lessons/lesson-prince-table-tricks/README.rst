This lesson shows to table tricks with PrinceXML. First, you can specify an
alternative table caption in case of a table split over two or more pages (see
`prince-caption-page` property in the HTML code).  Second, you can rotate the
content of a page while maintaining headers and footers (see the
`prince-rotate-property`). In addition, you can rotate content depending on
being on a left or right page.
