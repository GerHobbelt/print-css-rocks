Contributing
============

The print-css.rocks project is an open platform for spreading the word about
"CSS Paged Media" and "Print CSS". Feel to contribute further lessons and
showcases, pointers to documentation and resource etc.  You can either contact
me directly or you fork the project on Github and see me some pull requests.
print-css.rocks is supposed to be a living and growing project for the Print
CSS community.
