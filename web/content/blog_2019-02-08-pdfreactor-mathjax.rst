Rendering MathML using MathJAX in PDFreactor
============================================

PDFreactor up to version 9 came with a native MathML render which always had several layout issue.

The native MathML in PDFreactor 10 has been removed. MathML rendering is now supported through the
Javascript `MathJAX` library which is support in PDFreactor 10.

The rendering results are very good. You can find an example in this `lesson </lesson/lesson-pdfreactor-mathjax>`_.
